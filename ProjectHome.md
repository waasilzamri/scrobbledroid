# Scrobble Droid #

This application is a "scrobbler".

That means that it is software that watches the music you listen to and sends information about it to [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/), where they use that information to do things like make personalized charts for you and make recommendations about other music you might like.

This particular scrobbler is for the [Androidâ„¢](http://www.android.com/) mobile phone platform (as used on the [T-Mobile G1](http://www.t-mobileg1.com/)). It keeps track of the music you listen to using the "Music" application that comes with the phone (either the standard Android Music app or the modified HTC one that is used on the HTC Hero).

# Download #

**Scrobble Droid** is now available via the Android Market (for free). If you are viewing this on your Android phone then there is a link to it's Market entry [here](http://scrobbledroid.googlecode.com/svn/web/market).
